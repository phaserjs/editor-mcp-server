const USER_PROPERTY_DESCRIPTIONS = `

- "number": A numeric property. The value is a number.

- "string": A text property. The value is a string.

- "boolean": A true/false property. The value is a boolean.

- "color": A color property. The value is a string representing a color in hexadecimal format, e g. "#ff0000" for red.

- "keycode": A Phaser keyboard key code property. The value is a string representing a keyboard key, e g. "SPACE", "A", "ENTER". All the values in the \`Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyCodes\` enum.

- "expression": Any javascript valid expression. The value is a string representing the expression, e g. "this.player.x", "Math.random() * 500".

- "option": A property that can be one of a set of predefined string options. The value is a string representing one of the options. When the the type is "option", the property definition must include the list of all the available options, in the "options" field. Look the "options" field for more details.

- "objectVar": A reference to a variable that is an object. The value is a string representing a valid JavaScript expression that points to an object in the scene. Like in \`this.player.leftHand\`. This type is kind of deprecated, use "object-ref" instead.

- "object-ref": A reference to another game object in the scene. The value is the 'id' of the game object.

- "constructor": A JavaScript expression that is a class. It could be a Phaser game object class or a prefab class. Like in "Phaser.GameObjects.Image" or "PlayerPrefab".

- "event": A reference to a Phaser event or custom user event. The value is a string representing the event name, e g. "pointerdown", "update", "my-user-event".

- "texture-config": A string that is an string-encoded texture configuration that is a JSON object with the 'key' and 'frame' of the texture, Like in '{"key":"bubbles","frame":"blue"}'. The 'frame' is optional if the texture is an image, like in '{"key":"background"}'. It is important, very important that you encode the JSON object as a string, so the value is a string. Don't forget to properly escape the string. The editor will decode it to an object when reading the property value.

- "animation-key": A string the key of a sprite animation. You can look for the available animations in the project with the \`assets-get-available-animations\` tool.

- "audio-key": A string that is the key of an audio asset.

- "asset-key": A string that is the key of an asset in the project. You can look for the available assets in the project with the \`assets-get-available-asset-packs\` tool.

- "scene-key": A string that is the key of a scene in the project. The scene key is the name of the scene file without the extension.

- "spine-skin-name": A string that is the name of a skin of a Spine skeleton.

- "spine-animation-name": A string that is the name of an animation of a Spine skeleton.

- "spine-event": A string that is the name of a Spine event.
